# Github_Stimulation
We made a github using data structures concepts in c++. We used hashing, trees, graphsin this code!
This allows users to create accounts, manage repositories, make commits, and follow other users. The application will be command-line based, focusing on the application of data structures such as linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
